## Why This Exists

Most independent restaurants in the US lose **$5,000-$25,000 per month** to four invisible problems:

1. **Unanswered negative reviews** silently drop their star rating
2. **Menu engineering blind spots** leave $2-5 per cover on the table
3. **Online presence gaps** cause new-customer searches to land on competitors
4. **Marketing dormancy** turns Instagram followers and email lists into dead assets

Restaurant marketing agencies charge **$1,500-$10,000/month** to fix these issues — and most owners can't afford that. The AI Restaurant Team turns Claude Code into a full restaurant marketing agency you can run from the command line. Run a full audit on any restaurant in 2 minutes and produce a polished, client-ready PDF report.

---

## What It Does

The AI Restaurant Team launches **5 parallel AI agents** to analyze any restaurant across:

| Agent | Weight | What It Measures |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| **Reviews & Reputation** | 25% | Star ratings, review volume, owner response rate, sentiment patterns, rating trajectory |
| **Menu & Pricing** | 20% | Kasavana menu engineering, description quality, pricing psychology, photo presence |
| **Online Presence** | 20% | GBP completeness, Yelp quality, website, delivery apps, NAP consistency |
| **Marketing & Engagement** | 15% | Social cadence, content quality, email/SMS, loyalty, community marketing |
| **Local Competition** | 20% | Head-to-head with top 5 local competitors, positioning gaps |

It then produces a composite **Restaurant Health Score (0-100)** with letter grade and a prioritized 90-day action plan.

### Feature Highlights

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Full Restaurant Audit** | 5 parallel agents analyze every angle simultaneously |
| **Restaurant Health Score** | Weighted composite 0-100 with A+ to F grade and signal |

| **Menu Engineering** | Kasavana matrix (Stars/Plowhorses/Puzzles/Dogs) with pricing recs |
| **Online Presence Audit** | GBP, Yelp, website, schema, NAP consistency check |
| **Food Photography Audit** | Shot list + photographer brief, ready to send |
| **30-Day Social Calendar** | Daily IG/TikTok/FB content with captions + hashtags |
| **Local SEO Strategy** | "Best [cuisine] near me" targeting with ready schema markup |
| **Facebook/Instagram Ad Copy** | 10 angles × 2 variants each, A/B testing framework |
| **Email & SMS Sequences** | Welcome, birthday, win-back, abandoned cart, loyalty |
| **Competitor Analysis** | Head-to-head with top 5 local competitors |

## How It Works — The 5 Parallel Agents

When you run `/restaurant audit <name>`, the orchestrator:

1. **Phase 1 — Restaurant Discovery (20-30s):** Locates the restaurant on Google, Yelp, TripAdvisor, delivery platforms. Captures cuisine, type, price tier, hours, contact info, and key ratings.

2. **Phase 2 — Launch 5 Parallel Agents (60-90s):**
   - **restaurant-reviews** — Reads recent reviews across platforms, identifies themes, scores reputation
   - **restaurant-menu** — Acquires menu, applies Kasavana matrix, analyzes pricing psychology
   - **restaurant-presence** — Audits GBP, Yelp, website, delivery, NAP consistency
   - **restaurant-marketing** — Evaluates social cadence, content quality, retention programs
   - **restaurant-competition** — Identifies 5 direct competitors, builds head-to-head scorecard

3. **Phase 3 — Synthesis (20-30s):** Computes composite Restaurant Health Score, generates 90-day action plan, projects revenue opportunity.

Total runtime: **2-3 minutes** for a complete audit.

---

## Scoring Methodology

The **Restaurant Health Score (0-100)** is a weighted composite:

| Category | Weight | What It Measures |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| Reviews & Reputation | 25% | Star ratings, volume, response rate, sentiment, trajectory |
| Online Presence | 20% | GBP, Yelp, website, third-party platforms, NAP |
| Menu & Pricing | 20% | Menu engineering, pricing psychology, photos, upsells |
| Local Competition | 20% | Position vs top 5 local competitors |
| Marketing & Engagement | 15% | Social, ads, email, loyalty, community |

### Grade & Signal

| Score | Grade | Signal |
|-------|-------|--------|
| 85-100 | A+ | **Excellent** — minor optimizations only |
| 70-84 | A | **Strong** — some areas need attention |
| 55-69 | B | **Average** — significant opportunities |
| 40-54 | C | **Below Average** — multiple critical issues |
| 25-39 | D | **Poor** — losing customers daily |
| 0-24 | F | **Critical** — losing money every day to competitors |

---

## Restaurant Types Supported

| Type | Key Analysis Focus |
|------|-------------------|
| **Quick Service (QSR)** | Drive-thru speed, app ordering, delivery integrations, value perception |
| **Casual Dining** | Ambiance, wait times, family-friendly, menu variety |
| **Fine Dining** | Reservations, wine list, chef positioning, special occasion marketing |
| **Cafe / Coffee Shop** | Morning rush, wifi/work signals, loyalty, food pairing |
| **Pizza / Delivery** | Delivery times, third-party platform ratings, large order discounts |
| **Ethnic Cuisine** | Authenticity signals, cultural marketing, neighborhood positioning |
| **Bar / Brewery** | Happy hour, events, age demographics, food pairing |

## Want to Sell This as a Service?

Restaurant marketing agencies charge $1,500-$10,000/month for what this tool produces in 3 minutes. Here's the pricing playbook:

### Productized Service Pricing

| Package | What's Included | Recommended Price |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Audit (one-time)** | Full audit + PDF report + 30-min walkthrough call | $497-$997 |
| **Starter Retainer** | Monthly audit + review responses + 4 social posts/wk | $1,500/mo |
| **Growth Retainer** | Starter + Meta ads management ($500-$1,500 spend) + monthly content | $2,500/mo |
| **Full Marketing** | Growth + email/SMS automation + loyalty setup + monthly photography | $3,000-$5,000/mo |
| **Multi-Unit** | All of the above × locations | $1,000-$1,500/location/mo |

### Where to Find Clients

1. **Run audits on free Yelp/Google leads** — restaurants with 50-150 reviews, 3.5-4.0 stars (the sweet spot). They feel the pain, can afford the fix.
2. **Cold email with the audit attached** — "I noticed [specific finding from audit]. Here's the full report. Want to talk?"
3. **Local restaurant Facebook groups** — share generic insights, DM owners privately
4. **Restaurant industry conferences** — NRA, regional events
5. **Partner with restaurant POS resellers** (Toast, Square) — they want add-on services

### Sales Conversion Tips

- Lead with the **revenue opportunity number** ("I found $8,400/month you're leaving on the table")
- Show the **PDF report on the call** — it justifies the price
- Always offer a **paid audit first** ($497) — converts at 30-50% to retainer
- For the audit close, position retainer at **3x audit price** (anchoring)

**Average agency revenue per client: $24,000-$60,000/year.** Six clients = a real business.
